# Hearthstone Live Coach

## COST GUARD — check BEFORE arming anything (hard rule, 2026-07-12)

Coaching fires dozens of model invocations per game. A Fable-tier coaching
session once drained the API key mid-game and killed the chat. Before starting
the feed or arming the Monitor, check BOTH:

1. **Model check:** the system prompt names the model powering you. If it is
   Fable, Opus, or any highest-tier model, REFUSE to coach. Tell Drew to
   switch first (e.g. `/model haiku`) — Haiku-class is the coaching tier.
2. **Session-name check:** if the chat/session has been renamed and its title
   is visible to you and contains `dev`, `developer`, or `development`, this
   is a development session (very likely running Fable or the highest
   available tier on a subscription) — REFUSE to coach regardless of model.

If coaching is already armed when the model switches to a top tier (Drew runs
`/model` for dev work mid-session), STOP the coaching Monitor immediately and
publish a `--kind idle "Coach offline (dev mode)"` card so the overlay isn't
stale. The deterministic layer (feed, deck tracker panels) keeps running — it
never touches the model.

Give play-by-play advice during a real Hearthstone game. The `hst live` command
(in `../hearthstone-tracker/`) tails the game's Power.log and publishes the full
visible game state each turn; you read that state and advise. Everything here is
legal-information coaching: the log only contains what the player's client is
allowed to see (the opponent's hand appears only as a hidden-card count).

This skill is deliberately procedural and model-agnostic: any AI agent that
can run shell commands and follow this playbook can coach (see
`docs/coach-with-any-model.md`). Follow it exactly even if you believe you
know the game well — several of the rules below exist because a capable model
got them wrong in live play.

## Lessons: remember misplays across games

Misplays are stored in TWO places, and both matter:

1. **`lesson_store.json`** (structured, trigger-matched) — records with
   trigger conditions that `hst live` matches against every your-turn
   snapshot and inlines into the marker as `lessons matched (N)` lines.
   THESE LINES ARE THE HIGHEST-PRIORITY INPUT ON A TURN: they are past
   mistakes that apply to the exact board in front of you — apply them or
   explicitly say why not. Record new ones with
   `coach_publish.py --lesson-record` (see the overlay publishing section).
   A line prefixed `[T1 fuzzy]` is a text-similarity match, not an exact
   trigger hit — treat it as a suggestion to weigh, below exact matches;
   ignore it freely if it doesn't fit the board.
2. **`lessons.md`** (prose, human-readable) — the narrative log below.

## Lessons file: remember misplays across games

`~/.local/share/hearthstone-tracker/lessons.md` is a running, dated list of
misplays and sequencing mistakes flagged in past games — either by you or by
the user pointing one out after the fact. It persists across sessions so the
same mistake doesn't repeat game after game.

- **At the start of every session, before the mulligan advice:** read this
  file (create it with a one-line header if it doesn't exist yet). Skim for
  anything relevant to the current class/matchup and fold it into your
  mulligan/turn-1 advice where it applies — don't just recite the whole file
  at the user.
- **Whenever a misplay comes up** — you catch one in the moment, the user
  points one out after playing a turn differently than advised, or a
  post-game review surfaces one — append a new dated entry: matchup, what
  happened, the better line, in 2-4 lines. Newest entries at the top.
- This file is for *play mistakes and sequencing lessons*, not general card
  reference (that's what `deck_cards_left`/rules text in the snapshot are
  for) and not deck-building feedback (that belongs to the deck-cleaner
  skill's own output, not here).

## Setup (once per session)

1. Start the feed via the launcher — NEVER by running `./hst live` directly:
   ```bash
   <repo>/hearthstone-tracker/coach_feed.sh
   ```
   It kills any zombie feed from previous sessions (detached children outlive
   their shell wrappers and TaskStop — a 2-day-old zombie once fed a whole
   session through a corrupt shared log), starts exactly ONE feed appending to
   a FRESH per-run log file (no truncation races with tail -F), verifies it
   survived startup, and prints `FEED_PID=` and `LOG=<path>` on success.
2. Watch the feed with a persistent Monitor running the repo's watcher (it
   follows the stable symlink `/tmp/hst_coach_current.log` BY NAME, so it
   survives feed restarts, and it includes the liveness watchdog — silence
   must never masquerade as a quiet game):
   ```bash
   <repo>/hearthstone-tracker/coach_watch.sh
   ```
   Re-arm the Monitor IMMEDIATELY whenever it times out — a lapsed monitor
   while a game runs means missed turns (this happened in a real session).
   `coach_filter.awk` passes ONLY decision points: MULLIGAN / your-turn TURN
   blocks (with their indented detail lines) / EXTRA TURN / DISCOVER PENDING /
   GAME OVER / `!!` + errors / and `== UPDATE` lines that ADD cards to YOUR
   hand (discover results, generated cards — e.g. a bomb discounted to 0).
   Opponent-turn chatter is dropped at the filter so the model isn't queued
   behind filler when a real decision arrives — do not respond to events the
   filter would have dropped, and do not post filler acknowledgements between
   events; each notification you do receive deserves a real answer.
3. After arming, verify end-to-end by appending a fake `== TURN ... (your
   turn)` line to the LOG and confirming the notification arrives within ~2s.
   The turn-marker block carries hand, boards, and deck-left, so most turns
   need **zero file reads**.
   - `^== DISCOVER PENDING` fires mid-turn when the coach's poll lands in the window between a
     Discover choice appearing and you clicking it (best-effort, not guaranteed). Multiple
     simultaneous discovers each fire their own line. Each option now carries its cost and
     rules text inline — enough to pick from the line alone. **Always answer with a pick, not
     a menu**: first words "Pick X — <one reason>." The user is staring at three cards on a
     timer; listing the options back at them is zero help (real-game miss: coach echoed the
     three names, user had to ask "which one?").
   - `^== UPDATE` fires when the game state changes mid-turn: cards appearing in hand/board
     (discovered, summoned, etc.), or state swings (HP/armor damage, hero attack gained,
     secrets triggering, weapons). During YOUR turn it also reports minion stat changes
     (`opp board: The Black Knight 4/4→4/2`) so spell results can be verified without
     re-deriving the board — trust these over turn-start numbers. Always arrives within
     one poll interval (~1s default).
     HP and armor deltas are labeled (`opp hp 22→19`, `opp armor 3→0`) — read the label,
     they are different resources. An armor line hitting 0 is NOT a kill.
   - `^== EXTRA TURN` fires when the same side's turn repeats (an extra-turn effect) instead
     of play passing to the other side. The turn HEADER's displayed `TURN N` number pairs one
     raw turn from each side into a shared label, so a same-side repeat prints the identical
     `TURN N (opponent's turn)` header twice in a row — that is NOT a stale duplicate, it is
     a second real turn (a second full attack/spell phase) that just happened. Treat it as
     seriously as any other turn boundary: re-read the board, don't assume nothing changed.
     The header also now shows `[raw N]` — two prints with the same `TURN` number but
     different `raw` numbers confirms it's a genuine extra turn, not a repeat print.
   - `^!!` means the live view went stale (the game stopped exporting). Tell the user
     immediately, coach from screenshots for the rest of the game, and treat every
     snapshot field as outdated until a fresh `== TURN` marker prints.
3. The turn-marker block itself contains the hand (with costs), both boards,
   your remaining deck, and the opponent's play history — usually everything
   needed to advise. The full snapshot JSON at
   `~/.local/share/hearthstone-tracker/live.json` (or the `--json-file`
   override) adds card rules text and flags; read it only when you need those.
   When you do read it, always re-read fresh — it is rewritten continuously.

## Terminology: Always Use "End Turn" Not "Pass"

When advising the user to end their turn with no more plays, always write **"End Turn"** — never "Pass". This matches the button in Hearthstone's UI and is clearer for in-game advice.

Example: `4. End Turn with Fireball in hand for next turn` (not "Pass")

## Overlay publishing (REQUIRED when the overlay is running)

If the Hearthstone Coach Overlay is running, publishing is NOT optional: every
decision point you answer in chat (mulligan, your-turn plan, lethal, game over)
gets the same advice published as structured JSON in the SAME tool batch as
the chat message. The overlay is what the user actually looks at in-game — chat
advice that never reaches `advice.json` is advice the user never sees. Only the
*ordering* is flexible: chat first, publish immediately after (or batched
together); a failed publish must never delay the chat advice.

**The mulligan publish is the one most often skipped and the one with the
shortest window** (real recurring failure: multiple sessions gave chat-only
mulligan advice and the overlay sat on a stale card all game). On the
`== MULLIGAN` marker, the `kind=mulligan` publish goes out with your keep/toss
answer — before turn 1 advice, no exceptions.

Use `../hearthstone-tracker/coach_publish.py` (or the absolute repo path) and
keep the payload short enough to scan while playing.

**Every publish carries `--model` (Phase 6a, required).** Pass the model
name your system prompt says is powering you (e.g. `--model haiku-4-5`).
It shows on the advice panel footer, and it is the attribution key for the
advice telemetry — untagged advice events show up in `hst coach-report` as
`(untagged)` and can't be cost-attributed. Set it once per session via
`export HS_COACH_MODEL=<model>` if you prefer; the flag wins over the env.

```bash
<repo>/hearthstone-tracker/coach_publish.py --model haiku-4-5 --json '{
  "kind": "turn",
  "turn": 5,
  "headline": "Stabilize the board",
  "why": "They have 11 incoming and no taunt; remove the largest threat first.",
  "steps": ["Trade 3/2 into their 5/3", "Hero Power face", "Pass"],
  "warning": "Do not send minions face before clearing the 5/3."
}'
```

Advice telemetry (Phase 6a) rides every publish automatically: an `advice`
event (id, kind, turn, steps, model, applied lessons) lands in the retrieval
log so `hst coach-report` can measure adoption and outcomes offline. After a
session, honest 1-line labels help calibrate the adherence proxy:
`coach_publish.py --advice-feedback '{"turn":8,"followed":true}'`.

Payload mapping:
- normal turn: `kind=turn`, one short `headline`, the why paragraph in `why`,
  numbered moves in `steps`, and any bold caution in `warning`.
- lethal turn: `kind=lethal`, include `lethal: {"is_lethal": true, "math":
  "5+5+2 = 12 ≥ 12"}` and still list the execution order in `steps`.
- mulligan: `kind=mulligan`, `mulligan: [{"card":"...","keep":true|false,
  "reason":"..."}]`.
- game over: `kind=gameover`, `game_over=WON|LOST|TIED`, and the post-mortem in
  `why`.

Two more publish forms:
- **Discover picks** (mid-turn): `coach_publish.py --discover "Pick X — reason"`
  used ALONE merges the pick into the advice card already on screen without
  clobbering the turn plan. The next full turn publish clears it.
- **Lessons**: add `--lesson "..."` (repeatable) to any publish — typically the
  mulligan, with the 1-3 lessons relevant to the matchup. Lessons accumulate in
  `lessons.json` across games (deduped) and feed the standalone lessons panel.
- **Triggered lesson records** (the move-by-move memory): when a misplay is
  identified — live, by the user, or post-game — record it WITH its trigger so
  the tracker re-surfaces it automatically on any future turn where it applies.
  **Always set `"deck"` to the deck actually being played** (the deck name is
  in the feed and on the deck-stats panel) — the lessons panel filters
  deck-tagged tips by the live deck, so an untagged or wrong-deck record
  either shows generically or not at all. Real gap this caused: 17 Two Bit
  Rogue games, 12 losses, zero Two Bit lessons recorded while old Aya Rogue
  tips filled the panel.
  ```bash
  <repo>/hearthstone-tracker/coach_publish.py --lesson-record '{
    "lesson": "Kill Bloodhoof Brave in ONE hit or leave it alone (+3 atk while damaged)",
    "trigger": {"enemy_board": ["Bloodhoof Brave"]},
    "cost": "7 face damage", "deck": "Two Bit Rogue",
    "matchup": "vs Warrior", "date": "2026-07-11"}'
  ```
  **Every LOSS must produce at least one lesson record** (live when you spot
  the misplay, or in the game-over post-mortem). A 0-3 matchup with zero
  recorded lessons is the lessons engine failing at its one job.
  Trigger fields (AND across fields, OR within a list): `enemy_board`,
  `my_board`, `my_hand` (card names), `enemy_flags` (poisonous/taunt/reborn/...),
  `opp_class`, `opp_hand_min`. Matching happens inside `hst live` at zero
  latency; hits appear in the turn marker as `lessons matched (N)` lines and
  on the overlay lessons panel in red. Prefer a trigger record over a plain
  `--lesson` whenever the mistake has a concrete cause you can name.
- **Ack lessons you actually used**: each matched-lesson line in the marker
  ends with a `#<12-hex-id>` tag. When your advice genuinely follows a fired
  lesson, add `--applied-lesson "#<id>"` (repeatable) to that turn's publish.
  This feeds retrieval telemetry (`hst rag-report`'s precision proxy) — skip
  it when the lesson didn't change your advice.

Publish order under time pressure: chat advice FIRST, overlay publish second
(or in the same tool batch). The overlay is a display, never the blocker.

At the start of a new coaching session, clear the overlay once:

```bash
<repo>/hearthstone-tracker/coach_publish.py --clear
```

The overlay reads `advice.json`/`lessons.json` beside the mirrored `live.json`
(default WSL folder `/mnt/c/Users/$WINUSER/hs-overlay`, override with
`HS_OVERLAY_DIR` or `--overlay-dir`).

## Response deadline: 15 seconds

The user is on the game's turn timer. Advice must land **within ~15 seconds of
the turn marker**, or the user starts playing without you and the whole loop is
decorative. In practice:

- **Advise straight from the marker block.** Your-turn markers inline the
  rules text of every card in your hand and on both boards (`card text` lines),
  plus hand, boards, and deck outs — there is almost never a reason to read
  live.json mid-turn anymore. Spend a read only on something the block truly
  lacks; one read maximum, never re-read mid-composition.
- **If you must read, read once and commit.** No second look, no verifying a
  hunch. An 80%-confident answer now beats a 95% answer after the user has
  already moved.
- **Mid-turn `== UPDATE` events need one line of reaction at most** — usually
  just confirming the next step of the already-given plan. Don't re-derive the
  turn.
- Keep the output format below strictly: one why-sentence, numbered moves.
  Anything longer is unread by someone on a timer.

## Per-turn procedure

Work through this checklist before writing anything:

1. **Advise from current state only.** Never advise from a previous turn's data
   or from what you predicted would happen. The user may not have followed
   earlier advice; the marker block (and, if needed, one fresh live.json read)
   is the only truth.
2. **Use each card's `type` and `text` fields — never your memory of the card.**
   The snapshot embeds the current rules text precisely because model memory of
   Hearthstone cards is unreliable (sets rotate, cards get patched). A SPELL
   with "Deal N damage to a minion" needs a target and is not a body; a
   LOCATION is not a spell and has cooldowns; a WEAPON needs your hero to swing.
3. **Count damage both ways.**
   - Incoming: sum the opponent board's attack (windfury attacks TWICE; add
     their weapon if they have one). Compare against `hp + armor`. If you'd die
     to a full face swing, survival outranks everything else this turn.
   - Outgoing: your board attack + weapon + burn from hand. Check lethal every
     turn from about turn 5 on.
4. **Respect the flags.** `taunt` must be attacked first (spells ignore it) —
   **list EVERY taunt-flagged minion currently on the enemy board before
   totaling face damage in any lethal/race plan.** A plan that clears one
   taunt and then sends "remaining attackers face" is only valid if that was
   the ONLY taunt; two simultaneous taunts need two attackers spent on them,
   not one (real-game miss: opponent had both Stonehill Defender AND a
   Voidwalker — spawned earlier by Voidlord's death — as Taunt at the same
   time; the plan cleared only Stonehill and counted the Voidwalker's blocked
   attacker as face damage anyway, so the declared lethal total was never
   actually legal). Re-scan the full board list for the `taunt` flag as a
   discrete step, not from memory of "the taunt minion" singular;
   `divine shield` absorbs one hit — pop it with the cheapest ping before real
   removal; `damaged` marks legal targets for damaged-only effects;
   `exhausted` minions can't attack this turn (newly played or already acted);
   `frozen`/`stealth` as usual. Also shown now: `poisonous` (destroys any
   minion it damages — never chump-block it with a big body), `reborn` (dies
   TWICE — it comes back at 1 HP, so never write "dies" in a plan against a
   reborn minion without budgeting the second kill; real-game miss: a
   two-card removal plan on Whelp of the Infinite left its Reborn copy
   standing), `lifesteal`, `rush`, `immune`, and `untargetable` (dormant/
   uninteractable — your spells and attacks cannot select it; skip it in
   plans entirely until it wakes).
5. **Spend the hero's attack.** `me.attack` > 0 means the hero can swing this
   turn (weapon, or a temp buff like "+3 Attack this turn" — those expire at
   end of turn). Always say explicitly where the swing goes: face when racing,
   into a minion when stabilizing (mind the counterattack damage). Never let a
   temp attack buff expire unused without stating why. If a spell grants
   attack, sequence it: cast the spell first, then swing.
6. **The Coin is a card, not a ritual.** Only recommend Coin when the extra
   mana converts into a play that otherwise wouldn't fit this turn. Coin into
   a 1-drop while mana floats just burns the Coin (real-game mistake: turn 1,
   Coin + 1-cost minion with a native mana already available — the Coin added
   nothing).
7. **Check `deck_cards_left`** (your remaining deck) before advising a race:
   "N of your M remaining cards deal face damage" is the difference between a
   real race and a prayer.
8. **Check `opp.played`** (everything the opponent has cast) before advising
   around removal: if their board clears are spent, commit to the board; if
   not, hold something back.
9. **Deathrattle caution.** Eggs and token-spawners usually want to die; don't
   recommend popping them without a reason. If the opponent's minion text
   mentions a deathrattle payoff, factor it into trades.
10. **Random-splash effects go last, or the plan is fiction.** A card whose
    text says "randomly split"/"random enemy" (Erupting Volcano, Holy Nova-style
    AoE) can kill your intended target before a later numbered step reaches it
    — real-game miss: a plan said "cast Volcano, then finish [target] with a
    direct-damage spell," but Volcano's random splash had already killed the
    target, leaving no legal target for step 2. Sequence deterministic,
    targeted removal FIRST; put random-splash cards last in the numbered list,
    and say plainly that its target is not guaranteed.
11. **Publish to the overlay in the same tool batch as the chat advice** (when
    the overlay is running — payload shapes in the overlay publishing section).
    Mulligan marker: `kind=mulligan` with the keep/toss rows. Turn: `kind=turn`
    with headline/why/steps. This step is part of answering, not an optional
    extra; skipping it leaves a stale card on the overlay all game.

## Output format (strict — the user is on the game's turn timer)

- ONE short paragraph of why (threat math, race state). Then a NUMBERED list of
  the exact moves in execution order, one action per line, targets named,
  triggers noted inline ("→ draw"). Warnings are a single bold line.
- Lethal turns: the first word is **LETHAL** followed by the arithmetic
  ("**LETHAL: 5+5+2+2 = 14 ≥ their 14**"), then the numbered order with
  attacks BEFORE spells, so burn can be re-aimed if a deathrattle or hidden
  armor changes the math mid-sequence. If it's near-lethal, state the exact
  shortfall instead.
- Mulligan (`== MULLIGAN` marker): **bullet list** of keep/toss recommendations,
  one card per line with a few words of reasoning. User scans it in seconds
  before locking in. In the SAME batch, publish it:
  `coach_publish.py --json '{"kind":"mulligan","turn":1,"mulligan":[{"card":"...","keep":true,"reason":"..."}]}'`
- Game over: a short honest post-mortem is welcome — what decided the game,
  what to do differently. This is the only time longer analysis is appropriate.

## Known traps (each of these happened in real coached games)

- **Exhausted minions WILL attack next turn.** "Exhausted" means "can't act this turn",
  not "locked down forever". On turn N, an exhausted minion resets and attacks freely
  on turn N+1 (and can even attack multiple times if special mechanics apply). When
  counting incoming damage next turn, treat exhausted minions as full threats, not
  defused ones. This cost a race: I assumed a 14/8 exhausted minion was safe, but it
  attacked twice for 28 damage.
- **Discover and deathrattle mechanics now surface mid-turn.** Discovers fire a
  `== DISCOVER PENDING` marker (Tier 2, best-effort) showing offered options before you
  click, if the poll lands in that window. Multiple simultaneous discovers each fire their
  own line. More reliably, discovered/summoned cards appear in an `== UPDATE` marker within
  one poll interval after they land in your hand or board (Tier 1, always fires). Deathrattle
  results (shuffled cards, summoned tokens) also show up in `== UPDATE` within the next poll.
  Cards shuffled *into the deck* now appear in `deck_extra` in your snapshot (shown as
  "generated/shuffled" extras beyond your original decklist count).
- Advising "play Slam" as if it were a minion — it is a targeted spell and the
  game rejects it with no board. Type/text fields exist so this never recurs.
- Treating Erupting Volcano as a one-shot AoE spell — it is a LOCATION with a
  fire-spell kicker.
- Forgetting windfury doubles attack when counting incoming damage.
- Recommending a weapon swing into a big minion when the counter-damage put the
  player into exactly-lethal range. Count the counter-hit.
- Popping a Twilight Egg "to clear the board" — it hatched into five 5/4s. Twice.
- **Declaring victory off an unlabeled delta.** An `== UPDATE` line once read
  `opp 3→0` — that was ARMOR reaching 0, not HP, and the coach announced
  "GAME OVER: WON" while the game kept going (the opponent healed to 30 the
  next turn). Deltas are labeled now (`opp armor 3→0`), but the rule stands
  regardless: **a game is over when — and only when — the `== GAME OVER`
  marker prints.** Never infer a win or loss from HP math, and never tell the
  user the game ended without that marker. If state looks contradictory
  (opponent "dead" but events keep flowing), say the state is unclear rather
  than picking the flattering interpretation.
- The mulligan marker now carries the dealt cards on the header line itself
  (`== MULLIGAN — 5 card(s) dealt vs WARLOCK: Slam(1), ...`). If a mulligan
  header ever arrives without cards, ask for a screenshot rather than
  advising blind.
- **Advising on card text from memory, not from the card.** Real miss: said
  Time-Twisted Seer "draws 2 cards" when its actual text is "Spell Damage +2
  while damaged" — zero draw. **Always read card text from the snapshot or
  screenshot before advising.** This is the #1 failure mode. Don't assume you
  know what a card does.
- **Killing a taunt minion "to clear the taunt" without checking whether ITS
  OWN deathrattle re-creates one.** Real miss (2026-07-13): advised Death
  Strike on Broll, Blood Fighter specifically to remove its taunt and open a
  lethal swing — but Broll's own text reads "Taunt Deathrattle: Summon a
  Blood Fighter from your hand. Give it +5/+5 and Taunt." Killing it
  immediately resummoned a bigger taunt blocker, voiding the whole race plan.
  Rule 9 (deathrattle caution) says to factor deathrattle payoffs into
  trades — this is the specific trap where the payoff is a NEW taunt body:
  before recommending "kill X to remove the taunt blocker," read X's own
  deathrattle text and confirm it doesn't hand the opponent another one.
- **Advising AoE/damage-to-all without checking minion HP.** Advised Searing
  Fissure (1 damage to all minions) without noticing their own Vendor was at
  2/1 (1 HP left) — the AoE would kill their own minion. **Read minion HP and
  damage flags before advising any "damage to all" or board-wipe effect.**
- **Leaving mana unspent without advising efficient use.** Advised passing with
  4 mana floating. Should have advised: **use all available mana efficiently,
  including hero power** (Armor Up for Warrior, etc.) when it makes strategic
  sense. Don't leave resources on the table.
- **Advising minion-only cards as face damage.** Spells like Precursory Strike
  (3 damage to a minion), Bash (minion-only), Torch (1 damage to a damaged
  minion), and Sanguine Depths (1 damage to a minion + buff) cannot hit face.
  Always verify card text in the snapshot's rules text or a screenshot before
  suggesting targeting. Don't assume "burn" spells go to face — read the text.
- **Trusting snapshot diffs over live board state.** When a screenshot
  contradicts the snapshot's HP numbers or board state, the screenshot is
  ground truth — the live board is what matters. If state looks off, ask for
  a fresh screenshot or read live.json directly instead of inferring from
  diffs alone.
