# Live-coach event filter: pass ONLY the lines the coach must react to,
# so each notification is an actionable decision point and the model isn't
# queued behind opponent-turn chatter.
#
# Emits:
#   - == MULLIGAN block (with indented detail lines)
#   - == TURN blocks ONLY for "your turn" (with detail lines)
#   - == EXTRA TURN blocks
#   - == DISCOVER PENDING lines (options are inline)
#   - == UPDATE lines ONLY when cards were added to MY hand mid-turn
#     (discover results / generated cards — e.g. a bomb discounted to 0),
#     or when board minion stats changed DURING MY TURN (so the coach sees
#     post-spell values instead of doing math on turn-start numbers)
#   - == GAME OVER
#   - !! stale-feed warnings, Tracebacks, Errors
# Everything else (opponent-turn updates, hp ticks, play-history lines) is
# dropped: the your-turn block always carries the full current state anyway.
